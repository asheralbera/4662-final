            <h1>Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and epilepsy</h1>
            <p>
                One of the neurological manifestations of Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS) is epilepsy in various forms. 
                Epilepsy is the fourth most common brain disorder in the world and it presents with unprovoked recurring seizures—a manifestation 
                of excessive electrical activity within neurons that alters the exchange of communication between brain cells
                <a href="https://www.epilepsy.com/what-is-epilepsy" alt="Epilepsy foundation website"> (Epilepsy Foundation, n.d). </a>
                While epilepsy isn’t always paired with physical impairments or daily disabling effects, different patients experience the disorder in
                personal ways, including but not limited to those who are unable to work or drive, and 1 in 1,000 people diagnosed with epilepsy who experience 
                <em>sudden unexpected death in epilepsy</em> (SUDEP) <a href="https://www.epilepsy.com/what-is-epilepsy" alt="Epilepsy Foundation website"
                        > (Epilepsy Foundation, n.d.). </a>
            </p>

            <p>
                The disorder is linked to a variety of causes such as genetics, brain trauma, autoimmune disorders, metabolic issues, or infectious diseases. 
                Different causes and different elements of an individual's experience can lead neurologists to diagnose different types of epilepsy, 
                such as sleep-related epilepsy, photosensitive occipital lobe epilepsy, eating epilepsy, and many more 
                <a href="https://www.epilepsy.com/what-is-epilepsy" alt="Epilepsy Foundation website"
                        > (Epilepsy Foundation, n.d.). </a>
                However, it is often hard to know the exact cause, and many patients never receive an accurate source to their symptoms 
                and are solely diagnosed with a generalized seizure disorder
                  <a href="https://www.epilepsy.com/what-is-epilepsy" alt="Epilepsy Foundation website"
                        > (Epilepsy Foundation, n.d.). </a> As previously mentioned, one of the known and recorded connections to Epilepsy is Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS).
            </p>

            <p>
                A study by Savastava et al. (2015) reports the case of a 1 year old girl diagnosed with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) and suffering from afebrile seizures. 
                While seizures in infants might be common and inconsequential when high fevers are present, 
                afebrile seizures are signs of underlying seizure disorders and further examination on brain matter and function was recommended to the patient. 
            </p>

            <p>
                The girl showed signs of periventricular heterotopia (PH), a condition where neurons of the brain fail to migrate in the optimal
                position during early stages of development because of collagen malfunctions; these neurons instead form nodules and lumps, 
                which are often discovered after a first seizure is witnessed <a href="https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/condition/periventricular-heterotopia/"
                                                                                  alt=" Medline Plus webpage on periventricular heterotopia"> (Medline Plus, 2020).
