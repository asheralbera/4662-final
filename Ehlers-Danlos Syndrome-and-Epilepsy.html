            <h1>Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and epilepsy</h1>
            <p>
                One of the neurological manifestations of Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS) is epilepsy in various forms. 
                Epilepsy is the fourth most common brain disorder in the world and it presents with unprovoked recurring seizures—a manifestation 
                of excessive electrical activity within neurons that alters the exchange of communication between brain cells
                <a href="https://www.epilepsy.com/what-is-epilepsy" alt="Epilepsy foundation website"> (Epilepsy Foundation, n.d). </a>
                While epilepsy isn’t always paired with physical impairments or daily disabling effects, different patients experience the disorder in
                personal ways, including but not limited to those who are unable to work or drive, and 1 in 1,000 people diagnosed with epilepsy who experience 
                <em>sudden unexpected death in epilepsy</em> (SUDEP) <a href="https://www.epilepsy.com/what-is-epilepsy" alt="Epilepsy Foundation website"
                        > (Epilepsy Foundation, n.d.). </a>
            </p>

            <p>
                The disorder is linked to a variety of causes such as genetics, brain trauma, autoimmune disorders, metabolic issues, or infectious diseases. 
                Different causes and different elements of an individual's experience can lead neurologists to diagnose different types of epilepsy, 
                such as sleep-related epilepsy, photosensitive occipital lobe epilepsy, eating epilepsy, and many more 
                <a href="https://www.epilepsy.com/what-is-epilepsy" alt="Epilepsy Foundation website"
                        > (Epilepsy Foundation, n.d.). </a>
                However, it is often hard to know the exact cause, and many patients never receive an accurate source to their symptoms 
                and are solely diagnosed with a generalized seizure disorder
                  <a href="https://www.epilepsy.com/what-is-epilepsy" alt="Epilepsy Foundation website"
                        > (Epilepsy Foundation, n.d.). </a> As previously mentioned, one of the known and recorded connections to Epilepsy is Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS).
            </p>

            <p>
                A study by Savastava et al. (2015) reports the case of a 1 year old girl diagnosed with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) and suffering from afebrile seizures. 
                While seizures in infants might be common and inconsequential when high fevers are present, 
                afebrile seizures are signs of underlying seizure disorders and further examination on brain matter and function was recommended to the patient. 
            </p>

            <p>
                The girl showed signs of periventricular heterotopia (PH), a condition where neurons of the brain fail to migrate in the optimal
                position during early stages of development because of collagen malfunctions; these neurons instead form nodules and lumps, 
                which are often discovered after a first seizure is witnessed <a href="https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/condition/periventricular-heterotopia/"
                                                                                  alt=" Medline Plus webpage on periventricular heterotopia"> (Medline Plus, 2020). </a>

            <p>
                Periventricular heterotopia (PH) is recognized in multiple research studies as a possible cause of the comorbidity of 
                EDS and epilepsy, as it is connected to collagen, which as a form of connective tissue is not entirely functional in EDS patients 
                (Castori & Voermans, 2014; Cortini, & Villa, 2018; Sakka et al,. 2017; Savastava et al., 2011; Savastava et al., 2015; 
                Verotti, Spartà et al., 2014; Verotti, Monacelli, et al. 2014). In Savastava’s case (2015) 
                the study posed new questions as the patient showed unilateral PH, rather than the previously reported bilateral PH. 
                The newly-found report is once again a reason to further investigate the neurological aspects of EDS. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Periventricular heterotopia (PH) is however not the only connection between EDS and epilepsy, 
                as proven by Verotti, Monacelli, et al. (2014) in their study comparing EDS patients with and without PH showing symptoms of epilepsy. 
                While the study does recognize a stronger connection and medication resistance when PH is present, 
                the existence of EDS patients without PH does call for a more detailed understanding of the comorbidity (2014). 
                Verotti, Monacelli, et al.’s study (2014) connects the comorbidity to a <em>disruption in the link between the
                    extracellular matrix and cytoskeleton with consequent malformations of the vessels and brain parenchyma</em>
                (p. 821). In other words, the supporting components of brain tissue (extracellular matrix) and the collagen proteins that shape cells 
                (cytoskeleton) are not able to link in the correct matter; this disruption causes vessels and brain tissue including 
                neurons and support cells (brain parenchyma) to develop in an abnormal way.
