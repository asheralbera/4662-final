# Final Assignment Commentary

For this course's final, I opted for a Github pages site made with HTML because I think it is the one tool I need more practice with.
Other tools such as Oxygen, LibreOffice, DITA, etc. are more straightforward, and I was able to get comfortable with them quite qickly, with HTML instead, it's still a learning curve, and will probably be for a long time. 

For example, to complete the assignment I had to learn how to create a functional navigation bar to include the different pages required, and how to format a header split into two different sections, to have one on each side of the page.

Creating the CSS style guide took a very long time, and I had to go back and forth to it multiple times as I included more sections per page. However, I still found it very enjoyable to see how different styles affected the look of the page. This is still one of the main things that really fascinate me about using HTML, it allows
for such a great range of freedom compared to other tools we've used during the semester, and the more I learn, the more I can expand that freedom even further.
I think this aspect of making a project look very unique, is lacking from tools like Oxygen——which is not necessarily a bad thing, having easily accessible consistency
can be amazing, but I think that it's not what best represents me as a person, outside of what I may end up doing in the line of work. 

I also believe that, even outside of this project, a website would be an approriate tool to share a research paper, and this reasoning was also what pushed me to chose a Github page rather than other formats. 

I've used this specific paper in the course before, so the majority of the work was put into creating the foundation of the site, and its stylesheet. I had already
added images and links to meet previous requirements, so I was able to really focus on more technical aspects, rather than spending a lot of time on making sure the
content had all the necessary components requested.
