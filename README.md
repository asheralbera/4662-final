# Final Assignment Commentary

For this course's final, I opted for a Github pages site made with HTML because I think it is the one tool I need more practice with.
Other tools such as Oxygen, LibreOffice, DITA, etc. are more straightforward, and I was able to get comfortable with them quite qickly, with HTML instead, it's still a learning curve, and will probably be for a long time. 

For example, to complete the assignment I had to learn how to create a functional navigation bar to include the different pages required, and how to format a header split into two different sections, to have one on each side of the page.

Creating the CSS style guide took a very long time, and I had to go back and forth to it multiple times as I included more sections per page. However, I still found it very enjoyable to see how different styles affected the look of the page. This is still one of the main things that really fascinate me about using HTML, it allows
for such a great range of freedom compared to other tools we've used during the semester, and the more I learn, the more I can expand that freedom even further.
I think this aspect of making a project look very unique, is lacking from tools like Oxygen—which is not necessarily a bad thing, having easily accessible consistency
can be amazing, but I think that it's not what best represents me as a person, outside of what I may end up doing in the line of work. 

I also believe that, even outside of this project, a website would be an approriate tool to share a research paper, and this reasoning was also what pushed me to chose a Github page rather than other formats. 

I've used this specific paper in the course before, so the majority of the work was put into creating the foundation of the site, and its stylesheet. I had already
added images and links to meet previous requirements, so I was able to really focus on more technical aspects, rather than spending a lot of time on making sure the
content had all the necessary components requested. I also managed to start working on the site very early on, before I was too busy with other final projects, 
and this allowed me to focus on small details, make sure that everything looked exactly the way I wanted it to, and that everything was doing what it was supposed to do (links,
nav bar, alt text, etc.).

The only negative aspect of chosing a Github repository that I can think of, is that HTML is a tool that more likely will appear in other of my courses, so I might not get 
many other chances to use the other tools learned in this course until they show up in an internship or a job position. However, this can be easily fixed. 
During the winter break, and then even in the summer, I plan to start making a lot of personal projects that I can include in a portfolio and/or a job application. 
For these, I will try and use a variety of different tools, both to keep practicing them until they are fully rooted in my brain, but also to showcase 
what I am able to do to a future employer. I think that especially as an International Student I need to make sure I appear as the best candidate possible, 
because the fact that I will eventually need a Visa sponsorship when I'm out of college already puts me one or two steps behind everyone else—regardless of my abilities. 
Making more and more projects using the tools I've learned in this course will certainly be part of what I can do to try and stand out.

As a last note, I'd like to thank you Jim for being an amazing instructor, and for sharing your clear passion in technical writing with me. This has been an amazing semester, 
and I hope our paths will meet again, either in the classroom, or outside of it.
