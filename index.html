<h1>The Under-considered Comorbidity Between Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome and Epilepsy: a Literature Review</h1>
           

            <p>
                The need of additional research and information on the connection between connective tissue disorders and neurological symptoms 
                is strongly highlighted by the majority of the experts in the field of multiple specialties, who are looking for better ways to diagnose, 
                treat, and support patients showing these symptoms 
                (Cortini, & Villa, 2018; Verotti, Spartà et al., 2014; Savastava et al., 2011; Verotti, Monacelli, et al. 2014; 
                Henderson et al., 2017; Castori & Voermas., 2014; 
                Ünalp et al., 2022; Kim et al., 2016). 
            </p>

            <p>
                The purpose of this literature review is to synthesize
                present studies and research on the neurological manifestations of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS), 
                with a particular focus on the <em>comorbidity of epilepsy</em>, first recorded in 1972 (Cortini, & Villa, 2018).
                This correlation between the two disorders is still highly uncertain, and attributed to various symptoms, malformations, 
                or malfunctions found in individuals with EDS. 
                This literature review is thus presented in an active medical discussion,
                with strong and present effects on patients around the world.
