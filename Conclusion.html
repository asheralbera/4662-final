<h1>Conclusion</h1>
            <p>
                All in all, it is clear that the scientific community has made great steps toward a better understanding 
                of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and its connection to neurological manifestations such as epilepsy. 
                A variety of different phenomena have been analyzed by a multitude of physicians, and hypotheses have been made. 
                A series of conditions related to the process of proteins and collagen, and the weakness of connective tissues have been 
                linked to an abnormal development of the brain and spinal chord.

                The most notable malformations of the nervous system that have been found in many patients with EDS are periventricular heterotopia, 
                polymicrogyria, and unspecified abnormalities caused by the impossibility of correct connection between neuron cells and collagen 
                (Castori & Voermans, 2014; Cortini, & Villa, 2018; Sakka et al,. 2017; Savastava et al., 2011; Savastava et al., 2015; 
                Verotti, Spartà et al., 2014; Verotti, Monacelli, et al. 2014). 
            </p>

            <p>
                However advanced and revolutionary these studies may be, scientists are still far away from fully understanding the matter, 
                and <em>extensive</em> additional research is needed in order to provide care to patients living with debilitating conditions. 
                Some of the conditions that accompany EDS can be <strong>fatal</strong>, such as epilepsy or strokes, and it is imperative that researchers 
                keep the conversation open to new discoveries. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Everyone, from patients to doctors, will benefit from future research and understanding of connective tissue disorders. 
                Such chronic illnesses can be overlooked and cause underlying disabling conditions that deepen the mistrust in doctors and the 
                fear of reaching out for help. When physicians are unable to diagnose chronic conditions, people can tend to rely on the internet for support,
                which can be additionally dangerous because of the wide spread of misinformation. 
            </p>

            <p>
               Doctors and researchers <em>must</em> come together to support patients of conditions that can have a varying spectrum of symptoms 
                that cannot be recognized by a single specialist. In the case of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, it should become customary to refer patients 
                to neurologists in the early stages of diagnosis. With this approach, epilepsy and other dangerous neurological conditions 
                can be preventively treated or avoided altogether.
