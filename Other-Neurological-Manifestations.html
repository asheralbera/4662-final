<h1>Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome and Other Neurological Manifestations</h1>
            <p>
               As previously discussed, epilepsy is not the sole neurological manifestation of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS). 
                While this literature review focuses on epilepsy, it is still important to note and better explain the additional neurological disorders 
                linked to EDS in order to gain an informed understanding of the condition. These neurological manifestations are also worth noting because 
                of their highly debilitating effects on patients, such as motor delays, coordination disorders, higher risks of neuronal injury, tremors, 
                and spasms—which significantly reduce the quality of life of individuals with EDS who are already facing daily pain and fatigue. 
                The conditions analyzed by Henderson et al. (2017) are reported to be particularly hard to detect and diagnose with standardized tests, 
                requiring instead specialized studies that not all physicians are familiar with. 
            </p>

            <p>
                An example-intracranial hypertension-is described by Henderson and a team of members of the International Consortium on the Ehlers-Danlos Syndromes 
                in a study to share with other medical experts at the EDS International Symposium (2017). The study researches neurological and spinal manifestations of EDS, 
                focusing on epidemiology, etiology, clinical findings, treatments, and areas needing further investigation. 
                For instance, intracranial hypertension is a condition in which the pressure surrounding the brain is particularly high due to the 
                <q><em>excess cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) production, reduced CSF absorption, excessive brain water content, and increased cerebral venous pressure 
                leading to reduced CSF reabsorption</em></q> (p. 197). Intracranial hypertension can cause intense sensitivity to light, and significant changes in vision, 
                with 10% of patients reaching complete blindness (Henderson et al., 2017). Additional symptoms that can strongly affect quality of life based 
                on their severity include headaches, nausea, vomiting, and tinnitus-a condition in which patients experience ringing in their ears, 
                a noise that can be so loud it incapacitates the ability to hear external sounds and can result in hearing loss (Henderson et al., 2017;

            <p>
                A different study, by Castori and Voermans (2014) delineates similar findings in regard to neurological aspects of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. 
                They heavily focus on cerebrovascular diseases, highlighting the connection between EDS and its blood vessel fragility 
                with <strong>strokes, aneurysms, spontaneous brain bleeds, and tearing of cervical arteries.</strong> 
                Vascular EDS can especially be the cause of strokes even in younger patients, who usually would not be considered at risk 
                (Castori & Voermans, 2014). Because of these risks, EDS should be tested for whenever vascular concerns arise. 
                Regardless of the clear signs in molecular testing that can easily identify the presence of vascular EDS, 
                patients often face serious consequences because Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is not taken into consideration and thus goes undetected (Castori & Voermans, 2014).
            </p>

            <p>
                Cerebrovascular manifestations in patients with EDS should also be regarded more seriously because of the dangers that can rise during treatment. 
                The fragility of blood vessels can be severely impactful on how a condition can be treated, and often physicians opt for more conservative methods 
                that lower the risk of fatal bleeds (Kim et al., 2016). While these methods may be effective, Kim et al.’s study (2016) 
                claims that they are often not the treatments that best fit patients with connective tissue disorders and must be updated as soon as possible.
            </p>

            <p>
                These studies (Castori & Voermans, 2014; Kim et al., 2016) bring to light unrecognized comorbidities with EDS and concerning treatment methods, 
                once again sharing with the medical community the urgency of improving the research surrounding Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. 
                The connection between the majority of neurological manifestations and EDS remains often completely unknown or unclear 
                (Henderson et al., 2017., Casori & Voermans, 2014). This lack of research and limited knowledge severely limits the access to diagnosis, 
                which can be deteriorating if not fatal, to all EDS patients; or even those with unknown and unspecified connective tissue disorders.
