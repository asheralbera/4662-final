<h1>Female Population</h1>
            <p>
                Additional research should also focus on the gender disproportion found in patients diagnosed with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. 
                Some of the literature analyzed in this review briefly alludes to the gender disproportion of EDS, 
                mentioning that women are more likely to have the connective tissue disorder rather than men 
                (Henderson et al., 2017; Verotti, Spartà et al., 2014; Verotti, Monacelli, et al. 2014). 
            </p>

            <p>
                Both of Verrotti’s studies (2014) have <em>significantly</em> more female patients—25 v. 17, and 77.3%—while Henderson et al. (2017) mention EDS having a <q><em>predilection</em></q> for females, in the same way chronic headaches and migraines do 
                (p. 196). Interestingly, the topic is never brought to attention, regardless of the intense stress on requiring additional research. 
            </p>

            <p>
                While it can be argued that these studies focus on neurological manifestations of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, 
                and thus shouldn’t necessarily highlight the gender disparity, as studies based on the necessity of moving research forward, 
                it is surprising that such a prominent factor is so easily overlooked. The misdiagnosing of EDS can lead to pain, fatigue, 
                and other symptoms to worsen significantly, which has the ability to affect the quality of life of individuals, leading people to 
                <q><em>[leave] their jobs, education, hobbies, and other activities as well as losing social and support networks, leading to anxiety, 
                depression, and even suicidal ideation</em></q> (Robbins, 2022. p. 175).
            </p>

            <p>
                Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and other forms of connective tissue disorders are found in women with a <strong>3:1 ratio</strong> compared to men,
                but still women are diagnosed on average with a <strong>delay of 16 years</strong> compared to 4 years delays for men (Robbins, 2022). 
                One of the theories as to why women tend to be more likely to have EDS is related to the <q><em>rapid growth associated 
                    with puberty or due to the increase of estrogen</em></q> (Robbins, 2022. p. 175). 
            </p>

            <p>
                However, this theory is loosely accepted, and additional research is certainly needed. Unfortunately, it is <em>not</em> surprising that a 
                condition that mostly affects women is yet to be understood and is undermined by medical professionals in a field predominated by men. 
                It is also of extreme importance to conduct studies including women, as EDS can have significant symptoms tightly related to the female reproductive system, 
                and can worsen during pregnancy and labor with the possibility of causing serious and debilitating injuries (Robbins, 2022).
