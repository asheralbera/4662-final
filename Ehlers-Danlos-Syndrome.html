            <h1>Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome</h1>
            <p>
                Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) is a group of genitive connective tissue disorders characterized 
                by joint weaknesses that causes hypermobility, fragile and elastic skin, and easily-ruptured blood vessels — which 
                is usually paired with repeating bruising (Savastava et al., 2011). Different variations of EDS are reported in medical
                literature, such as classic EDS or vascular EDS, in which the blood vessel fragility is more prominent, 
                and can lead to serious ruptures of arteries, namely the aorta, and hollow organs, 
                such as intestines and the uterus (Sakka et al,. 2017). 
            </p>

            <p>
                The most common type of EDS is <strong>hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome</strong> (hEDS), which is accompanied by a
                <em>50% chance</em> of passing the genetic mutation that causes the syndrome to each of a patient’s children
                <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ehlers-danlos-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20362125" alt="Mayo  Clinic web page
                    on Ehlers-Danlos syndrome"> (Mayo Clinic, 2022). </a> 
                Frequently recorded complications include: joint dislocations or subluxations (partial dislocations), 
                early-onset arthritis, and high-blood pressure related to the fragility of blood vessels 
                <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ehlers-danlos-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20362125" alt="Mayo  Clinic web page

                dditional secondary symptoms can be proneness to injury, as well as longer healing periods, due to the fragility and elasticity of skin

            </p> 

            <p>
                The weakness of joints and other connective tissues can lead to:

                <ul>
                    <li>Instability;</li>
                    <li>Curvature of bones;</li>
                    <li>Quick degeneration;</li>
                    <li>Involuntary movement;</li>
                    <li>Malformations of the braind and/or spinal cord.</li>
                </ul>
            Lesser-known symptoms and complications are also likely to arise when EDS affects the development and functioning of the brain.

            <h2>A Multidisciplinary Syndrome</h2>

            <p>The different varieties of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) 
                are being studied and assessed mostly by rheumatologists and geneticists, 
                but part of the medical community is starting to push further the neurological 
                study of the connective tissue disorder, because of the multiple neurological 
                manifestations that can go undiagnosed without the presence of a trained neurologist (Castori & Voermans, 2014; Savastava et al., 2011).
                As such, Savastava et al. (2011), call for EDS to be considered a <em>“multidisciplinary pathology with a consequent multidisciplinary approach”</em>
                (p. 370). If such an approach were to be taken, 
                neurologists would be consulted in the initial phases of diagnosing Ehlers-Danlos syndrome in a way that would have the
                potential to significantly improve the quality of life of individuals with EDS who are presenting 
                with neurological manifestations that are currently often ignored, until they become too concerning and dangerous.
            
            </p>

            <p>
                The neurological manifestations reported in EDS patients can be divided into more common and known ones, 
                and those that require extensive research to be completely understood. Common manifestations, which are still not to be underestimated, are
                <strong>chronic pain, migraines, and headaches.</strong> Additional known, but less understood, comorbidities include: 

                <ul>
                    <li>Cerebrovascular disorders;</li>
                    <li>Intracranial hypertension;</li>
                    <li>Thethered cord syndrom; </li>
                    <li>Movement disorders;</li>
                    <li>Epilepsy;</li>
                    <li>Brain malformations and lesions such as:</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Periventricular heterotopia;</li>
                            <li>Plexopathy;</li>
                            <li>Polymicrogyria;</li>
                            <li>Chiari I malformation.</li>
                        </ul>
                </ul>
            (Savastava et al., 2011; Henderson et al., 2017; Castori & Voermans; 2014; Sakka et al,. 2017).
            </p>

            <p>
                Conditions such as chronic pain syndrome, headaches, and migraines are often 
                overlooked both by medical professionals and patients, as they tend to be considered insignificant, 
                or not relevant enough to justify further examination and testing - especially 
                when considering the elevated cost of medical support. 
                This tendency of undermining patient’s experiences, whether because of ignorance or bias, 
                is becoming a topic of mainstream discourse under the term of <em>medical gaslighting</em>. 
                The debate taking place majorly online, is thought to be a force towards 
                a desire for self-improvement from physicians, and can hopefully direct the medical community 
                towards better practices in all specialties (Ng, et al., 2024).
